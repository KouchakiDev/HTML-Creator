## Project Overview
Mini HTML Studio is a lightweight Flask application that exposes a simple UI for:
- Managing multiple small HTML projects (each project is a folder with `index.html`, optional `style.css` and `script.js`).
- Editing and previewing project files in-browser.
- Storing static helper data (CSS schema, tag attributes) for UI helpers and inspectors.

The repository already contains the server (`app.py`), templates and `static/` assets.

---

## Features
- Create / open / save small HTML projects.
- In-browser preview (iframe) and edit.
- Static assets served from `static/`.
- JSON resources (e.g., CSS schema) for in-app autocompletion or inspectors.
- Simple file structure suitable for publishing a single project as static site or running the Flask app for dynamic features.
